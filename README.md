# Forest Fire Detection System Using Deep Learning

This repository contains a deep learning model for detecting forest fires. The project uses advanced techniques to analyze satellite or aerial images and detect signs of fire in forests.

## Project Description

Forest fires are a major environmental hazard, and early detection can help save lives, prevent extensive damage, and aid in firefighting efforts. This system aims to identify forest fires using deep learning models, specifically trained on image datasets, to recognize signs of fire and smoke.

## Files Included

- **Forest_Fire_Detection_using_DL.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with the complete code for the model training, evaluation, and testing.

## Requirements

To run the project, you'll need the following libraries:

- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
